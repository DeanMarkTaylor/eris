Welcome to Eris's documentation!
================================

Eris is a porting of `QuickCheck`_  and property-based testing tools to the PHP and PHPUnit ecosystem.

.. _QuickCheck: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck

In property-based testing, several properties that the System Under Test must respect are defined, and a large sample of generated inputs is sent to it in an attempt to break the properties.
