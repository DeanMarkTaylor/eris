Features
- independent seed initialization of generators, which leads to reproducibility
-- check out https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib/blob/master/composer.json
- implies()
- 3D shrinking (or N-D): if generators A and B are shrinking, after A has arrived to the smallest value that still fails B should continue shrinking (see testEqualToReferencePhpImplementation).
- More and more generators, starting from Vector

Clarifications
-- the uniform distribution for genInt may be ok, but what should be the initial upper limit? Now it's 10 * $iterations
- readme should contains a detailed description
