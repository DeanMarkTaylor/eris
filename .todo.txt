- independent seed initialization of generators
-- which leads to reproducibility
- Generator interface
-- the uniform distribution for genInt may be ok, but what should be the initial upper limit?
- shrinking of generators A and B should continue shrinking B after A has arrived to the smallest value that still fails (see testEqualToReferencePhpImplementation).
- extract Trait for non-invasive use in PHPUnit test cases
- readme
- limits to shrinking in algorithm: all cases may fail
- check out scala check
