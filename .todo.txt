- independent seed initialization of generators
- generators should be objects
- find out the best distribution for genVector? it is not random at all
-- same goes for genInt, it is not random but starts from 0 and increases?
-- or maybe a good shrinking will bypass the problem, since you can start from an arbitrary point but then shrink to the simplest case that fails
- extract Evaluation object
- should shrink one at the time
-- should actually shrink, not just call them again
