+ support array of GeneratedValues being returned in Shrinker\Random (use only the first one)
+ extend Generator\Integer to provide multiple values (-1, /2)
+ allow configuration of method of ShrinkerFactory to call ('random' for now)
+ create an acceptance test in examples/ adding a log listener to check how it is shrinking
+ there, try to use 'multiple'
+ implement Shrinker\Multiple
++ here there will be many things to do
- composable Generators must support this in their shrink()
-- Tuple
-- Sequence
-- Map
-- Bind
-- probably others
- extract Shrinker interface
- extract GeneratedValue interface
- cover with ExampleEnd2EndTest the new example
- extend Listener with the result of shrinking (separate method shrinkingResult() or similar because if there is a shrinking attempt that takes long it's important to see it in the log)
