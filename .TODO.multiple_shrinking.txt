+ support array of GeneratedValues being returned in Shrinker\Random (use only the first one)
+ extend Generator\Integer to provide multiple values (-1, /2)
+ allow configuration of method of ShrinkerFactory to call ('random' for now)
- create an acceptance test in examples/ adding a log listener to check how it is shrinking
- there, try to use 'multiple'
- implement Shrinker\Multiple
-- here there will be many things to do
- composable Generators must support this in their shrink()
-- Sequence
-- Map
-- Bind
- extract Shrinker interface
- extract GeneratedValue interface
- cover with ExampleEnd2EndTest the new example
